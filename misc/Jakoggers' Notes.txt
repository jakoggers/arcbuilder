YOOOOO THIS IS JAKOGGERS YOUR FAVORITE PROGRAMMER EVER !!!!!

anyway notes formyself:

6/19/25
achieved:
	prompt + teams can be spliced: tested one team out, data can be trained
	teams were spliced form vgcpasted repo


for future me: (ffm)
- put a name to teams?
- loop through every team, add them to the pokemon_teams folder
- organize the folder lol.......

6/27/25
achieved:
	utilized vertical integration to integrate stuff together
	- translates to: Streamlined efficiency within the team_handler.py allowing its methods to be accesed in organize_data.py
	- created 800 files, all with the intent of putting in data but it never worked
	- errors are in hidden file


for future me:
fix issue where it doesn't worrk - me at 2am
the name isn't working??
idk


6/28-29/25
i finally fixed the error where the teams were not showing: hidden ofc, to save space.
